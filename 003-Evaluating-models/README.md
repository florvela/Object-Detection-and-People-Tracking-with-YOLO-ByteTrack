# Evaluating Models

This directory contains notebooks designed for evaluating YOLO object detection models, specifically focusing on YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 architectures. Additionally, the folder includes code for saving evaluation outputs to text files, converting them to CSV format, and facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the evaluation results.

## Notebooks

### [Evaluate vs Original Dataset](eval_vs_original_dataset.ipynb)

In this notebook, you'll find instructions on evaluating YOLO models (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) on the original datasets they were trained on. The notebook provides guidance on loading the trained models and dataset, performing evaluation, and saving the evaluation output to a text file.

### [Evaluate vs Randomized Clips](eval_vs_randomized_clips.ipynb)

Evaluate YOLO models (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) on the randomized clips dataset, which is intended for testing purposes. The notebook outlines the steps to load models, perform evaluation, and save the evaluation results to a text file.

### [Understanding Output CSVs](understanding_output_csvs.ipynb)

This notebook delves into the process of reading and interpreting the CSV output files generated from the evaluation results. It explains the decisions and criteria used to select models for the final API, allowing for a clearer understanding of the evaluation outcomes.

## Usage

Feel free to adapt the evaluation settings, parameters, and criteria to suit your specific needs and objectives.

For any questions or assistance, don't hesitate to ask.
